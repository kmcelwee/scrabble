Draws data from respective CSVs and prints various tests.
Here are the definitions of the shorthand used.

* avg1st: The average score of the player who went first.
* avg2nd: The average score of the player who went second.
* percDif: The average percent differences between the two scores.
* percDifBingoEquals: The average percent differences between the two scores 
    when both players earned an equal number of bingos.
* percDifBingoUnequal: The average percent differences between the two scores 
    when both players earned an unequal number of bingos.
* avgBingoDif: The average difference in number of bingos won by each player
* percWinner1st: The percent of games won by the player who went first.
* percWinner1stBingoEqual: The percent of games won by the player who first 
    when the bingos won by each player were equal
* percWinner1stBingoUnequal: The percent of games won by the player who 
    first when the bingos won by each player were unequal
* percBingoEqual: The percent of games where both players had an equal 
    number of bingos
* avgBingoDif: The average difference between the number of bingos
